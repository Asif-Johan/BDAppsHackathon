## 🔧 Recommended Workflow for Mobile App Development (React Native + Firebase)

### **1. Planning & Setup**

* ✅ Define **core features** and **user flows** (e.g., onboarding, resume creation, applications, corporate rooms).
* ✅ Choose **UI library** (e.g., NativeBase, React Native Paper, or Tailwind with `nativewind`).
* ✅ Set up **project repo** (GitHub) and **Expo project** (`npx create-expo-app NexusConnect`).

---

### **2. Backend (Firebase Setup)**

> You don’t write Mongoose models here, but you *structure collections/documents* like you'd design schemas.

* ✅ Design your **Firestore DB structure** (like MongoDB collections):

  * `/users`, `/companies`, `/internships`, `/gigs`, `/applications`, `/rooms`, `/messages`
* ✅ Set up:

  * **Firebase Authentication** (email/phone/social)
  * **Firestore** (database)
  * **Cloud Functions** (for server-side logic like AI ranking, verification)
  * **Firebase Storage** (for resumes, profile pics)
* ✅ Write rules for **role-based access control** (students, companies)

---

### **3. Auth & Basic Navigation**

* 🔐 Implement **Sign-Up / Sign-In** flow (with Firebase Auth)
* 🔁 Set up **React Navigation**

  * Stack navigator (for auth & onboarding)
  * Tab/drawer for main app (e.g., Home, Dashboard, Rooms)

---

### **4. Frontend <-> Backend Integration Loop**

Use this loop for each feature. It’s just like your preferred MERN/Next.js style:

> 💡 Each time: first plan data flow, then backend logic/cloud functions (if needed), then UI

#### Example Loop for Each Feature (like Resume Builder):

**Step 1** – Create Firestore data structure
**Step 2** – Write Cloud Function (if logic is complex)
**Step 3** – Build the UI screen in React Native
**Step 4** – Integrate with Firestore (read/write)
**Step 5** – Test on Expo Go / emulator
**Step 6** – Polish UI & optimize UX

---

### **5. Chat System (Corporate Rooms)**

* Structure Firestore: `/rooms/{roomId}/messages/{messageId}`
* Implement:

  * Public room-based messaging
  * Restrict student-to-student DMs via rules
* Optionally use `GiftedChat` or custom UI

---

### **6. Notifications Integration**

* Set up **Expo Push Notifications**
* Integrate **bdapps SMS API** in Cloud Functions for SMS alerts

---

### **7. AI Features (Premium)**

* Use Firebase Cloud Functions to:

  * Analyze resumes (via OpenAI API or similar)
  * Match jobs
  * Summarize chat
* Expose endpoints or trigger functions on Firestore writes

---

### **8. Testing & Optimization**

* Test on real devices using Expo
* Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing
* Optimize images, reduce package size

---

### **9. Build & Deploy**

* Use `eas build` (Expo Application Services) to build APKs/IPAs
* Submit to Google Play Store and App Store

---
